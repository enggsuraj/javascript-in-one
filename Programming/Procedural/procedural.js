PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING

1) ðŸš— DIVIDED PROGRAM INFO SET OF FUNCTION. F()
2) ðŸ“Ÿ DATA STORED IN BUNCH OF VARIABLES. 
3) ðŸ™„ AS YOUR PROGRAM GROW YOU WILL FIND BUNCH OF FUCNTION, 
4) ðŸ˜® YOU WILL FINDS COPYING AND PASTING FUCNTION CODE AND ONE CHANGE IN ONE FUNCTION SEVERAL OTHER FUNCTION BREAKS.
5) ðŸ¥“ THIS IS WHAT ITS CALLED SPAGHETTI CODE.

// EXAMPLE

let name = "John";
let designation = "Software Engineer";
let salary = 30000;

function getBio(name, designation, salary) {
  return name + designation + salary;
}

console.log(getBio());

// EVERYTHING HERE IS DECOUPLED, WE HAVE TO ASSUME OR FIND BY LOGIC THAT THESE 3 VARIABLES BELONGS TO getBio() FUNCTION
