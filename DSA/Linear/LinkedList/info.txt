**** LL good at inserting and removing element
- eg: music player

- Constant requirement of change in data in inseritng and removing use LL.

array vs LL
- array : direct access
- LL : sequention access

- array shift whole block if new eleemnt added(disadvantage)
- LL just shift through next pointer.
